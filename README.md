📈 Insights Derived

Cars with fewer cylinders generally have higher fuel efficiency (MPG).

Fuel efficiency improved significantly across model years, especially after 1980.

Weight and horsepower are inversely related to MPG — heavier cars tend to be less efficient.

The forecast model indicates a steady improvement in fuel efficiency for newer models.
